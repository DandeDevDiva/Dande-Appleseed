<h2>Git to Know Github</h2>
<h3>But what the heck is GitHub and why are developers so excited about it?</h3>


<p> You may have heard that GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service, <br> or that it’s a social networking site for programmers.  <br> 
Both statements are true, but neither explain exactly why GitHub is special. <br> </p>

<h3>At the heart of GitHub is Git, an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds.</h3>
<p>Matthew McCullough, <br>  a trainer at GitHub, explains that Git, like other version control systems,  <br> 
manages and stores revisions of projects. <br> 
Although it’s mostly used for code, McCullough says Git could be used to manage any other type of file, <br> 
such as Word documents or Final Cut projects.  <br> 
Think of it as a filing system for every draft of a document. <br> 

Some of Git’s predecessors, such as CVS and Subversion, have a central “repository” of all the files associated with a project. <br> 
.
McCullough explains that when a developer makes changes, those changes are made directly to the central repository.  <br> 
With distributed version control systems like Git, if you want to make a change to a project you copy the whole repository to your own system. Y .
You make your changes on your local copy, then you “check in” the changes to the central server. <br> 
McCullough says this encourages the sharing of more granular changes since you don’t have to connect to the server 
 <br> every time you make a change. <br> 
</p>

<h2>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service</h2>
<p>GITHUB adds many of its own features. <br> 
While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface.</p>  <br> 
It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools <br> 
for every project. <br> 
</p>
<h2>The flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” –  <br> 
copying a repository from one user’s account to another.</h2>
<p>This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account.  <br> 
If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. <br> 
That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo. <br> 
</p>
<h2> – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful</h2>
<p>Gregg Pollack of Code School (which just launched a class called TryGit) explains that before GitHub, <br> 
if you wanted to contribute to an open source project you had to manually download the project’s source code,  <br> 
make your changes locally, create a list of changes called a “patch” and then e-mail the patch to the project’s maintainer. <br> 
The maintainer would then have to evaluate this patch, possibly sent by a total stranger, <br> 
and decide whether to merge the changes. <br> 
</p>

<h2>Where the network effect starts to play a role in GitHub</h2>
<p>
Pollack explains. <br> 
When you submit a pull request, the project’s maintainer can see your profile, <br> 
which includes all of your contributions on GitHub.  <br> 
If your patch is accepted, you get credit on the original site, and it shows up in your profile.  <br> 
It’s like a resume that helps the maintainer determine your reputation. The more people and projects on GitHub, <br> 
the better idea picture a project maintainer can get of potential contributors.  <br> 
Patches can also be publicly discussed. <br> 


Even for maintainers who don’t end up using the GitHub interface, GitHub can make contribution management easier.  <br> 
“I end up just downloading the patch anyway,  <br> 
or merging from the command line instead of from the merge button,” says Isaac Schlueter, <br> 
the maintainer of the open source development platform Node.js. “But GitHub provides a centralized place where people  <br> 
can discuss the patch.” <br> 


Lowering the barrier to entry democratizes open source development, and helps young projects grow.  <br> 
“Node.js wouldn’t be what it is today without GitHub,” Schlueter says.  <br> 

Besides its public facing open source repositories, GitHub also sells private repositories  <br> 
and on-premise instances of its software for enterprises.  <br> 
These solutions obviously can’t take full advantage of GitHub’s network effect, <br> 
but they can take advantage of the collaboration features.  <br> 
That’s how GitHub makes money, but it’s not alone in this market.  <br> 

Atlassian acquired a competitor called BitBucket in 2010.  <br> 
And earlier this year Atlassian launched Stash, a product that enables you to host private,  <br> 
on-premise Git repositories with BitBucket/GitHub-style collaboration features.  <br> 
The company also sells developer collaboration tools like the bug tracker Jira and the wiki Confluence. .
Competition from Atlassian, which took $60 million in funding from Accel Partners in 2010,  <br> 
could help explain why GitHub took this round of funding, and hint at some possible future directions for the company.  <br> 
For example, Schlueter says GitHub’s issue tracking feature could eventually compete with JIRA for some projects. <br> 
 .
The money may be in private and on-premise hosting, but the love is in the public repositories.  <br> 
Perhaps most importantly, GitHub has become the Library of Alexandria for code examples.  <br> 
Since Git encourages granular recording of changes, programmers, be they absolute beginners or experts,  <br> 
can trace the steps of some of the greatest developers in the world and find out how they solved thorny problems.  <br> 
But if GitHub were ever to meet the same fate as the Library of Alexandria,  <br> 
it could be reconstructed from all those local forks distributed on so many developers laptops all over the world.  <br> 
Regardless of how this investment works out, that’s a hell of a legacy for the GitHub team to leave behind.</p>
